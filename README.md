This is a class I took on D3.js.  It was a great refesher and I learned some new topics.  The instructor actually provided some of the framework, but as excercise we were to build out charts.  There are two more I need to complete for homework.

# D3 Workshop - Analytics Dashboard

Demo analytics dashboard used in a full-day workshop on D3.js!

## Getting Started

First of all, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then, follow these instructions in a command prompt:

    $ npm install -g browser-sync
    $ git clone https://github.com/victormejia/d3-workshop-playground.git
    $ cd d3-workshop-playground
    $ browser-sync start --server --files "**/*"

It should launch your default browser and you should see the following:

If you're curious to what we're going to build, append `/complete` to your url.
